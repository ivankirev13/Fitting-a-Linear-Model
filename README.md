# Linear-Regression

This is a project from my first year Statistics module at Imperial College London on fitting a linear model. The script is in the Fitting_a_Linear_Model.Rmd file and the steps are described as follows:

Step 1: Reading in the Data
Read in the data contained in data01738166.txt, and plot cost vs weight using a scatterplot. Does there
appear to be a linear relationship between the two variables?

Step 2: Fitting a linear model
Use the lm function to fit a linear model on weight and cost, where weight is the predictor variable and
cost is the regressor variable. Plot the line showing the estimated linear relationship. Note: you may wish
to transform or rescale weight and/or cost before fitting the linear model.

Step 3: Analysis of results
Using any output from the lm function as well as any additional plots, briefly discuss how well the data fits
the proposed model.

Step 4: Fitting a second linear model (if desired)
Given the results in Steps 2 and 3, if you think a better linear model can be found, perhaps by modifying the
predictor/regressor variables and the data set, do Steps 2 and 3 again for your modified linear model. If you
feel there are any unusual data points, provide justification.
